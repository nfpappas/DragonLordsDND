We look around the room but decide that we must go meet our fate with the mantacores. We notice that most are sleeping but the dad is awake and watching us. merric tells kallik he has a plan. At this point the manticor dad tells merric that he shoudl be careful of what spells he casts. He tells us his name is duma. kadeem and balthor tell him that we killed the hags. He does not believe us. 

We lead him out and he cant contain his joy now that they are dead. Merric tells him its our job and we are happy to do it.   We ask whats next for him but he doesnt know. We offer to take him off the island and perhaps give him an opertunity to get back at his real captors , cideron and lutheria. He talks us back to his cave and tells his wife and cubs to chill. merric goes to one of the piles and finds bones, 1,100 sp, 650 GP, 400GP  goblent , sapire necklas 1,500. Merric also finds a wooden box. Inside he finds a gear that looks like it will fit in the anticiterion. 

We discuss more the possibility to get all the creatures off of the islnad

merric searches the piles and finds a strange necklce made of gold teath (2000gp) , 1 reptilian silver skull covered in platinum, and could be worth 5k. otherwise its a lot of bones, flesh, rocks, etc. 

kallik finds 2 potions of greater healing and one very large chest. 

kallik and merric try to open the chest. Merric disppells the magic on it and then kallik adeptly opens it. Merric looks in and finds a dragon egg. He kinda freaks out and talks to kira. she tries to come immediately but is barred from the island. Kallik and merric decide decide take the chest back to the ship.

Meanwhile helios and kadeem are trying to help end the suffering of the ooze monster in the pool. Concurrently the mantacore family is walking by.  kadeem and helios get a boulder loose to kill the ooze a little to early and helios and kadeem have to save the mantacore children from being crushed. They successfully save them and kill the ooze. 

we all get on the ultros and prepare to set off
