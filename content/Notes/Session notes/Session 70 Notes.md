Merric and eira, after merric being thrown overboard and eira going to get him, go back on board the ship. We all start surveilling the deck. In particular humerous the owl starts doing medicine checks on the crew. we go down to the captains quarters.


Merric, when kadeem told eira and merric about the true nature of the beast ( a minotaur with a snake tail) merrik tried to remember but it caused him psycological pain. He passed out ( 0 hp to be precise). Merric knows that thinking about it hard caused his pain. 

balthor and merric go investigate the changed floorboard. Merric observes that the spell put on it is transmutation, enchantment, some illusion, and a peculior amount of necromancy forced into the spell.  Transmutation to move the board, enchantment because it needs to affect a creature, and illusion so that it does not look out of space. Not sure why the necromance. Merric reflecting on it, thinks that this is only possible through high level magic that put this together.  The ultros says it has never happened before. 

 Eira thinks it was done just to fuck wither her. Lutheria chumming the waters so to speak. Merric is unsure. Baltor agrees. 

While short resting , kadeep plays and the crew sings. The crew starts singing (what merric and eira know as a pirate shanty). 

we let our passengers off then head to the island of fire. We arriave to the sound of animals. we see a huge valcano in the center of the island.
