Merric and eira talk with adema. She says that she is not native to thylea but rather outside. She wants to go home.  Merric asks if she is part of the wings of the lost. She says she isnt part of the group because they dont like her but she has a vested interest in them succeeding.  She says she is from the fey wilds. It is for that reason that she chooses to distance herself because of the bad rep people get for being born a fey.  She also lets merric know the crew is concerned about balthor being captain. 

Kara reluctantly to go talk to vulcan about the end of the oath. 

We do some activities and then go to bed
we wake up and prepare to land on the island of the fates. We all agree that it would be pretty pointless to try to hide anything from them or to be stealthy. Direct approach is the best. Adema also makes us aware that there are some crew that should go into the secret bubble because of their dealins with the fates. Humerous the owl scout map maker, a goblin, and one person to watch the goblin. 

We make landfall as we hit a sandbar abruptly. We disembark. We get to a stagnant bog. It looks as though skeletal hands reach up through a tar pit looking ooze. This bog reminds us of the putrid bath at the mossy temple but far larger. Very slowly we see some sort of creature or pieces of the bog slowly reaching up the wall up to us. We walk faster. This cave system smells of sulfer. From the center cave comes a large lamia ( snake woman). She is clad in leather armor. She has 2 swards. One eye is covered by an eyepatch. 

There is a pool in the middle of the cave that is yellow. There are human larva in this pool. It looks as though they are screaming. We see the 3 fates. one seems shy hiding behind the oldest. The middle child looks strong independant? The snake lady welcomes us and welcomes back balthor, much to his surprise. She tells him shes sorry for leaving him but is glad to see him again. Balthor remembers that it was this woman who helped. 

We talk to the fates. They say they used their magic to take the anticitherion piece. They want to make sure that "the scales are balanced". fate wants us to help her recover after her exile by kronos. She tells us that gaius is blocking her return. She also tells us that ciderons daughter ( the oracle) . Her name is vercachi. Unfortunatly due to her intervention fate is not able to recover. 
She tells us that the scales are fate itself. The balance of fate is not just the balance of might. Stalemate is not progress and that is why we need to help balance fate. 

They also tell us that there are a number of individules from outside that are being used to change the scales. There are nymphs and fey fold that are usurpign the natural order. The must be removed. They are found at a secret village. 

There is an innocent that needs their help but they need us to bring a young child to them. She has been taken by bad people that want to harm them. 

Merric asks which is most impactful. They tell us that the oracle is the biggest problem. 

Right as we start grilling them about how and why this works the youngest sister goes to the back room. Balthor notices that she is about to cut all of our threads. He immediatly goes to stop her with fate braker. This starts combat
