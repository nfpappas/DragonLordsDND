Before we get to climbing the volcano a group of natives approach us.  They tell us that our presence is requested by their queen. We meet with them. Their queen , vytha, tells us that we have to be careful because their enemies, the fire walkers, will likely try to kill us/ stop us.

We ask about the island and the firewalkers. We also say we are curious about the legend that there is a titan class god here. She says that its no legend, its fact. We can pray to her if we could get to the mountain but again, will likely be attacked. 

We ask about people who wash up, and they just say that they aren't tough enough to live on the island.  WE absolutely do not believe them 

They invite us to a feast in our honor. We go to dine with them in their "the forest meets jeffery dahlmer" esq cannibal camp. Merric , being weary of the food, casts detect magic. As a result, kallik makes a distraction using his steel defender which the lizardfold do not like or understand. Merric successfully detects magic and finds only that one of the guards has a necklace and the queens ruby are magical. 

We finish our "meal". Then the queen announces that it is time for the ritual.  Merric does take issue with this and says its not nessicary. She at first thinks that he wants one of her older better sons. he says no, its just we are lucky and have our own rituals. Merric gestures to kadeem and says our tradition is music. In a way cooler and better way (dc 28 music check that steve could have defiantly made himself if he rolled)  started to play some gloria estephan konga music and cuban pete. He animates some tables and chairs much to everyone's surprise and amusment. Somewhat to the queens bemusement, she relents and agrees to follow our customs. 

We set off with a health distrust and mutual dislike of this tribe. 

After some time, we make it into the maw of the mountain. Merric sends an arcane eye inside to scout. 

Inside we see guards, some lizard folk with horse sized reptiles, a bridge guardian.  beyond that we see the barraks. Beyond that i find a relatively empty room. It has two bridges one going north one going east. Fallowing the path north, i see a chamber that are pretty bare that has a bunch of eggs, and snakes the size of men. They guarding the eggs like its a hatchery? going back, I  float in just as a lizard folk who is carrying feed for the giant lizards. He drops some and it roll through a solid wall. I follow it and its a narrow natural staircase that goes in therough the rock and it comes outside. I dont recognise that part of the island. Heading back inside, i go east and find another barraks. I go back to a turtle shell looking buidling. This looks like a throne room, It is defiantly inside a giant empty turtle shell. It looks like he is fiddleing with a staff that is completely made of gold. A firey red creature is next to the king. A relativley small copper dragon sleeps at the feet of the king.  I catch parts of a conversaion where the king is saying there is no god here except the god of storms. 

I sent the eye past the throne room see another berraks and further beyond. I send it to the center of the volcano and by luck (nat20 ) find a hole down in the valcano. I do not see a god but i do see a message written from helios (prime). It reads, he knows sidrons and lutherias secret. A suspiciously missing perfectly square room is found. Maybe a jail cell? but nothing else is there. 

THE NAME OF THE OTHER TITAN IS CHALCIA
