We talk more with valas. She is confused how the date changed and moved up. Its not something that people can just will away even if both parties agree. The "contract" so to speak is between 2 parties but is adjudicated by fate herself. 

She tell us that there may be more fates now. around 200 years ago the terms fates started popping up. The new fates may be the reason for it. even the people that washed ashore wanted to seek them out as their power may be growing in the absence of mistress fate herself. 

We convince [[Kira (npc messenger)]] and [[Queen Valis]] to speak to [[Vulcan]] themselves. 

Merric asks if anyone knows where [[King acustus]] got the dragons. [[Queen Valis]] thinks that he made a deal with syderon.  Vallis thinks he made a deal but not an oath. She think that their weekeness is that they are so young. 

Valis seems very mad about the destruction of the hatchery. She is also very  cold to the fact that she knows of the other silver dragon that gaius rides. 

Before we set sail, valis gifts us 100 sailors. she assures us of the protection and care for their families. She, in a rare move, apologizes to Kadeem for not believing him about his concerns about his family. 

Helios and balthor both get a haircut from the flamboyant court stylist.
