It is clear to us that we must fight the hags. Balthor gets a good first strike on the first sister. He also gains a new feat - fate breaker. Helios gets great hits on the sisters. kadeem also gets some gets his bag on the head of the approaching medusa and almost strangles her to death. balthor gets fingered to death, however he dosent die. It appears that his body was taken over by estor. Balthor does return to his body but we are not sure what happened.  Merric is able to deal the death blow to the escaping final hag as she runs deeper in the cave. The rest of us emerge bruised but victorious. We talk to the medusa and find that she was the result of a broken oath. She isnt sure if she wants to live any more. She does take a transformed shambling mound that kadeem transformed and takes it outside where she instantly kills it. We also find that balthors savior / surroget mother finished killing the youngest hag sister after she attempted to murder us.  

We also talk about how far we came in our journey. Merric suggest that nothing is impossible to us now, not even divinity. Kadeem is very unconvinced.
