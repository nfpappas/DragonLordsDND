________________________________________________________________________________________________________
What was the reason for the undocumented battle b/w Estor and Sydron that we saw in the mural in the mossy temple?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
What is the reason for Gauis' 5 silver scales in his hair?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
What is the significance of the black 'hole'/scar on Chandrus' back?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Does the order of the faces depicted in the carved artwork along the canyon walls en route to the Ultros' location correlate to the age of the gods/titans?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Does Kyrah know Thylea is still alive? 
		She didn't but does after Kadeem told the crew of his communication with her post isle of Yonder break-in. She seemed surprised by the revelation.


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Estor was Kyrrah's oathsworn. Why then does the ultros consider Kyrah an enemy? 
		Unclear, but it is confirmed that Ultros and Estor were not tied to one side

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
If the Ultros considers Kyrrah an enemy, then why was the dragon head painted blue, clearly depicting her, on the prow when it was found?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Does the Ultros consider the titans enemies? 
		Yes

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How was the Ultros created? The Ultros has said that it "liked to sing". Was the ship bound with an unwilling soul?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

We saw a vision depiciting Estor who heard the quote "Walk in the fires of Typhoon, become like a god". Did he attempt to reach godhood and fail?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How does Navigator Edema know how to use the Anti-Kytheria?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How did the five gods take a 'piece of divinity' from the Titans?
		Mytros challenged Sydon to a game of chance. She wagered her life, titans wagered a piece of their divinity. The game ended in a tie, Kyrrah took the moment to secure the pieces of divinity, seemingly at the cost of her mother's life

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Xander's gold & silver dragon was named Balmytra. Was he an oathsworn of Mytros? 
		Not fully confirmed but heavily implied
________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How is there a door made of a non native metal to Thylea on the Isle of Yonder, and why does the cult of Sydon seem unperterbed by its existence?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________
It seems Sydon doens't know what Kallik is. Does that imply Frostyl is someone not from Thylea?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
How were the fates(hags) allowed to usurp the original 'fate'?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
A bubbling pool of black ichor was found on the Island of fates that mirrors the smaller one found in the Mossy Temple. Does this imply Lutheria had a hand in getting the three hags in power, and do those who break an oath get tossed into the pool?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Morta mentioned that a number of fae and nymphs are 'usurping' the balance, and that they must be 'removed'. What balance is she talking about, and are they a force working against the titans?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
Kentimane was revealed to have 'stirred' sometime recently by the hag-fates. Does this imply someone somewhere is invoking his name?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________
If the hag-fates are removed, will original fate return? If she doesn't, then are oaths breakable? Could this lead to a path for the party to remove themselves from the oaths sworn to Estor and the Ultros?

^^^^^^^		BALTHOR		^^^^^^^
Balthor, either knowingly or otherwise, seems to be marking people for Estor. What is the significance of the mark?

Morta (one of the fate hags) says she was forced to leave Balthor by a 'formidable, stubborn force'. Is this force the original fate?


________________________________________________________________________________________________________

^^^^^^^		EIRA		^^^^^^^
Where are the remaining living members of Eira's former crew?
	The doctor is with the wings of the lost
	The helmsman's location is yet unknown
	The quartermaster was last said to be wounded in the wilds northeast of Estoria

Why is Eira not bothered by the sun as much anymore? 

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

^^^^^^^   HELIOS  ^^^^^^^
What is the significance of the smooth obsidian stone Helios carries and at times rubs?

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

^^^^^^^  KADEEM		^^^^^^^

________________________________________________________________________________________________________

^^^^^^^		KALLIK		^^^^^^^
Who is Frostyl and how is he related to the powerful factions and entities in Thylea?
	He originally started creating Kallik's kin to help people. "A goddess wanted him to make them for a war". It is unclear if this 'goddess' is referring to one of the five or Lutheria.

^^^^^^^		MERRICK		^^^^^^^
Merrick has increasingly clarified visions upon collecting a missing charm. Who are the people he is seeing?

Who was Merrick's 'master' and did they have a hand in causing his apparent amnesia?
