The bridge keeper we meet. Kadem knows him because of his past. He warns kadem decendant of agathon. He warns kadem and all of us not to mess with the temple. He also warns kadem that lutheria is dangerous and will want kadems blood. 

we get to the first tomb. Telemok of something. we see a warrior defeting all kinds of foes. tearing them appart with his bear hands. also carved there is "a punished fool who does not deserved to be rememberd" . Given what we know, bathor knows this has not been consecrated. 

We get to the next toumb. We get to the oathswarn of pythor. Most beautifle of the dragon lords. If but his sword work was as beautiful. adonis nerdigon. There is emphisis on his beauty rather then his abilities in combat. 

next tomb. Estora archlander. We cant make out swarn of section. Weapons carved out some sections of  the inscription. Kallik is able to see that it said oath swarn of kyrahshal. We see disturbing images of a man destroying dryands and other creaters. His dragon companion begs for mercy for other innocents. 

We see the tomb or rizon phobas oathswarn of vulcan. It is murals of battles. A heroic warior beating minitaurs. Minator skeletons are magic holding them in place

We see cosmo phobas's tomb son of rizon phobas. We notice that the floors and walls are covered in an oily substance that seem to move. The crypt keeper warns us of the questions we ask the black ooze that is there. Seemingly because it is cosmos tortured soul. 

nicholas phobas blessed of sideron. This tomb is the nicest. He wears a brestplate with the symbol of sideron lord of the storms. 

we come to the next tomb. It says issador horath. An athletic woman of regal bearing. always accompanied by a figure in a similar cloak as damon the crypt keeper. 

Myrto the magnificent. Two magnificent statues apear. He is depected as a man of huge wealth. 

Gregor horath this is empty. The mural and paintings show a man traversing the islands of thylea

Dorian neurdagon: soot darkens the floor and ceiling of this crypt. It has been left ajar. 

We see an 8 foot tall minituar come out of the tomb. He is weilding an axe and a shield. This is a white marbel tomb it has a bunch of weatherd columns. This seplcur is blocked by things. The name zandar is on this tomb. Everything seems somewhat damaged. I dont know how long ago.
